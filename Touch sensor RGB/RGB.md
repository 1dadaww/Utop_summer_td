This project uses a Raspberry Pi Pico to detect readings from 4 touch sensors. You can view the [schematic diagram](RGBsch.pdf). The full circuit design is available in the zip file [RGB control V3.zip](RGB%20control%20V3.zip).
The circuit design without analog conversion circuit is [RGB control without freq-analog.zip](RGB%20control%20without%20 
freq-analog.zip)

### Input Types

There are 2 different types of inputs:

1. **Frequency Reading Method:**
   - This method directly reads the frequency generated by each oscillator.
   - Pad C1 is related to pin 14, pad C2 to pin 15, pad C3 to pin 16, and pad C4 to pin 17.
   - The system senses the change in frequency when a finger is placed on each pad. The combination of pads being touched corresponds to an output that can be adjusted in the code.
   - The [RGB all combinations.py script](RGB%20all%20combinations.py) can be used to detect the frequency change for each input. Users need to measure and adjust the threshold frequency for each input and also modify the RGB output for each combination.

2. **Frequency to Analog Conversion Method:**
   - This method uses a frequency-to-analog circuit. The ADC reads the analog value and changes the color based on the changes.
   - Pad C1 controls input of pin 28, C2 controls Pin 27, and C3 controls Pin 26.
   - An example code [adc testrgb.py](adc%20testrgb.py) can be used to test the ADC value and control the brightness of the RGB LEDs based on the analog reading.

### Assembly

The assembled model looks like the diagram below:

A connector is required to connect the acrylic board to the PCB board. All screws used in the design are M3 screws.

- The 3D model of the connector for 10mm thick can be found in the file [connectorrgb v4.step](connectorrgb%20v4.step) and [connectorrgb v4.stl](connectorrgb%20v4.stl).
- The 3D model for single 5mm layer is available here: [connector5mm.step](connector5mm.step) and [connector5mm.stl](connector5mm.stl).
- The laser cutting file for single layer crylic board is available here: [rgbline2.pdf](rgbline2.pdf).
- The laser cuttig file for combining two acrylic boards is available here :[rgb250.pdf](rgb250.pdf).
