This project uses a Raspberry Pi Pico to detect readings from 4 touch sensors. You can view the [schematic diagram](RGBsch.pdf). The full circuit design is available in the zip file [RGB control V3.zip](RGB%20control%20V3.zip).

### Input Types

There are 2 different types of inputs:

1. **Frequency Reading Method:**
   - This method directly reads the frequency generated by each oscillator.
   - Pad 1 is connected to pin 14, pad 2 to pin 15, pad 3 to pin 16, and pad 4 to pin 17.
   - The system senses the change in frequency when a finger is placed on each pad. The combination of pads being touched corresponds to an output that can be adjusted in the code.
   - The [RGB all 20combinations.py script](RGB%20all%20combinations.py) can be used to detect the frequency change for each input. Users need to measure and adjust the threshold frequency for each input and also modify the RGB output for each combination.

2. **Frequency to Analog Conversion Method:**
   - This method uses a frequency-to-analog circuit. The ADC reads the analog value and changes the color based on the changes.
   - An example code [adc testrgb.py](adc%20testrgb.py) can be used to test the ADC value and control the brightness of the RGB LEDs based on the analog reading.

### Assembly

The assembled model looks like the diagram below:

A connector is required to connect the 10mm thick acrylic board to the PCB board. All screws used in the design are M3 screws.

- The 3D model of the connector can be found in the file [connectorrgb v2.step](connectorrgb%20v2.step).
- The laser cutting file for the acrylic board is available here: [rgbSVG.svg](rgbSVG.svg).
